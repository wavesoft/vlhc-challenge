	We just started a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" target="_blank">Virtual Computer</a> in your machine. It is a <a href="http://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/" target="_blank">CernVM Linux</a> machine that runs the experimental software CERN and it's collaborators have developed. This <em>virtual computer</em> is going to simulate particle-particle collisions, excactly like the ones that occur in the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider" target="_blank">Large Hadron Collider</a> at CERN.
